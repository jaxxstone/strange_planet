# strange_planet
The problem from study of finite automata (per Stanford source, originally created by Jay Misra, see: http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/ialc/spr10/slides/fa1.pdf).

Two types of python program are uploaded, one that can be executed as standard python (15b), and one that requires ipython (15a).
For ipython version, the Junyper IDE was used. 

For either type, the Neo4j is required (unless you comment all Neo4j related lines), as well as all libraries listed in the import section (use pip install <lib> or conda install <lib> depending on your environment).
